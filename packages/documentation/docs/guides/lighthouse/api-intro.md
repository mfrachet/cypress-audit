# Available metrics

With Lighthouse 6, we're now able to make assumptions on **categories** and **audits**.

The categories are what we're used to with Lighthouse and provided a score between 0 and 100:

- performance
- accessibility
- best-practices
- seo
- pwa

The audits are things like the first meaningful paint and the score is provided in milliseconds:

- first-contentful-paint
- largest-contentful-paint
- first-meaningful-paint
- load-fast-enough-for-pwa
- speed-index
- estimated-input-latency
- max-potential-fid
- server-response-time
- first-cpu-idle
- interactive
- mainthread-work-breakdown
- bootup-time
- network-rtt
- network-server-latency
- metrics
- uses-long-cache-ttl
- total-byte-weight
- dom-size
