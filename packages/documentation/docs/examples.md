In order to verify the state of this projects, automated tests are run on CI on examples projects. These projects are located in the [examples folder](https://github.com/mfrachet/cypress-audit/tree/master/examples) and contain audits for:

- [create-react-app (with authentication)](https://github.com/mfrachet/cypress-audit/tree/master/examples/cra-authenticated)
- [nextjs](https://github.com/mfrachet/cypress-audit/tree/master/examples/nextjs)
- [testing on external URLs](https://github.com/mfrachet/cypress-audit/tree/master/examples/external-url)

If you have a specific configuration or are running using a specific tool, you can add a project example and make it part of the CI process.
